Efficient Residual-Based DCNN and Transfer Learning Models for Automating Brain Tumor Classification in MRI”

The project focuses on automated brain tumor classification using MRI images by leveraging:

Transfer learning models (InceptionV3, Xception)

A hybrid AlexNet + MobileNet architecture

A proposed Residual-Based Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN)

The proposed model achieved a maximum accuracy of 98.02%, outperforming state-of-the-art transfer learning approaches.
